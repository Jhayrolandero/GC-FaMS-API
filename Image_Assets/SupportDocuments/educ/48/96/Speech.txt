People before only believe that 's there are only 2 sex, man and a woman, they believe that only opposite sex can engage in union and become one
However, Todays generation, many genders emerged and now it contradicts the belief of the old time as two same sex can be as one legally however 
here in our country, a firm believer of catholic teaching, it's still a debate if it's time to legalize such act


i have to side with Theological teaching and don't agree in legalizing it.
In accordance with the Old Testament, particularly Genesis 19, 
homosexual behavior is explicitly condemned. 
Participation in such activities is considered a sin, if it's an act
against the divine will of God. Therefore, there is no justification for engaging in behaviors that
contradict the clear teachings of religious doctrine.

From the perspective of my faith, marriage is a divine ritual established by God, and its not for a man rights to alter it. 
The concept of marriage, as outlined in Genesis 2:24, 
specifically involves the union of a man and a woman. Applying the term "marriage" to same-sex unions distorts the essential
purpose of marriage, as defined by religious teachings.

Psalm 5:4 emphasizes that You do not love your neighbor by encouraging them to engage in actions that 
invoke God’s wrath and oppose God’s good design for humanity. 
When it comes to the concept of same-sex marriage, You cannot love your neighbor and encourage them to engage in 
activity that will lead them to hell. supporting it contradicts the Old Testament's rejection of homosexuality 
then if i advocate in activity of same sex marriage then im just supporting inviduals to go away from the love of God 
and codemn them into the depths of hell. 

In conclusion, i sided with the theological teaching as the divine teaching have a said against the homosexual behaviour as mentioned in psalm 5:4
Advocating for same-sex marriage is seen as leading individuals away from the love of God and potentially condemning them to spiritual
consequences. marriage is viewed as a sacred institution established by God, with its essence defined in Genesis 2:24 as the union 
of a man and a woman. Applying the term "marriage" to same-sex unions is considered a distortion of this purpose. But before i wrap it all up
if you think that what you are believing is right, then its up to you, just have a conviction and resolve to do so, if you love one person regardless 
of sex then no one is really stopping you. in the end it doesn't really matter as long as you are happy.






















The rejection of homosexual behavior that is found in the Old Testament is well known. In Genesis 19 If it's truly a sin and my religion believe so and it's a violation againt the will of God 
then there's no reason to go such length of commiting a sin. 


Yet gay men and men who have sex with men remained most at risk of contracting HIV, along with female sex workers, drug users and transgender women, the Global Aids Update 2018 report noted.

For me it's a no
The Old Testament, specifically in Genesis 19, explicitly condemns homosexual behavior. 
According to the tenets of my faith, participating in such conduct is viewed as a sin and a violation of God's divine will. 
herefore, there is no rationale for  committing a sin, considering the unequivocal teachings and guidance provided by the religious doctrine.
there's also a saying in psalm 5:4 "You do not love your neighbor by encouraging them to engage in actions that invoke God’s wrath and oppose God’s good design for humanity"
in the essence of same sex marriage, keeping in mind that the old testament rejects homosexuality so if i support same sex marriage then im just encouraging them to engage in activity that will lead them to hell.
Marriage was invented by God, not by man. We have neither the authority nor the ability to change what marriage is. The most that an individual or a government can do is misapply the term to relationships that are not actually marriages.
 Marriage requires the specific form of a union of man and woman (Gen. 2:24). Applying the term to same-sex unions, therefore, alters the very concept of what a marriage is for and what functions it takes.
